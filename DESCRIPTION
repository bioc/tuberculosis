Package: tuberculosis
Title: Tuberculosis Gene Expression Data for Machine Learning
Description:
    The tuberculosis R/Bioconductor package features tuberculosis gene
    expression data for machine learning. All human samples from GEO that did
    not come from cell lines, were not taken postmortem, and did not feature
    recombination have been included. The package has more than 10,000 samples
    from both microarray and sequencing studies that have been processed from
    raw data through a hyper-standardized, reproducible pipeline.
